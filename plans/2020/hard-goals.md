# HARD Goals - 2020

## Grow in Front-End
#### Heartfelt

Working on the front-end will make it easier to use some of my artistic skills and my creativity.
Those are 2 skills, that I want to continue investing into.

Knowing that I'm user-oriented, going to front-end development will also help me to get closer from our customers which will increase my motivation and sense of purpose in my daily work.

#### Animated

I want to be able to express myself more, working in design where there's no black and white answer but where feelings are more important than established design patterns suits me more.

After my first job, I always have missed the link between what I do and what impacts it has on the customer, seeing customers happy or angry at your work is more fulfilling than closing a story on board.The leap might always be there while working in the front-end, however I think it's gonna be easier to interact with them and if that requires extra work on my side, I'll gladly do it. 

#### Required

Being able to use some of my passions and interest in my daily work will for sure have a big impact the quality of my work and my involvement in the projects.

#### Difficult

Most of my engineering career as be done in the back-end.

I have grown and gained some reputation in my team working with JavaScript and CSS recently but it is still far from enough to think about a career switch yet.

Steps: 
- "You don't Know JS book" series: read, summarize, exercise
- Learn more about React: to be defined
- Improve on the css: to be defined

#### Notes

This relates a lot to my [personal philosophy](/personal-philosophy.md).

## Continue my personal development

#### Heartfelt

I love to read about how to improve my myself as a human being. It has already helped me a lot in rewiring my thinking process. I want to continue on this path and I wanna share what I learned so that others people can benefit from it.

#### Animated

The process of realizing that everything is possible and really believing it, is something strong but not always easy to feel. Let's fight to think that even more everything is possible, reaching stuff I would never even think of.

#### Required	

It's part of who I am, always willing to improve and be better.
In addition, it could help me in my future career, especially to become a line-manager.

#### Difficult

Going out my comfort zone and assimilating knowledge to be able to use it on a daily basis is not easy.

I want to learn more about:

- Psychology
- Optimism
- Management 3.0

## Being healthier (mind and body)

#### Heartfelt

I want to feel better, happier and having more energy when I wake up and tired when I go to sleep.

It's always good to take some time to care about myself.

#### Animated

There are plenty of days where I don't know what I did at the end of the day. 
I want less of those days.

I realized that when I do sport (running, yoga or work-out) my days seems are better and I have more the feeling that those days were useful.

While running, I do not enjoy that much the process but I love to keep pushing it further until I reach my objective. Then I have that pure proud feeling of both succeeding and beating that little negative voice inside. I also enjoy seeing the improvements after every run.

#### Required		

Having better and more fulfilling days.
Nothing is more important than being healthy.

#### Difficult

I see 3 pillars that I want to keep to be more healthy:

- Sport: Running, Yoga and Gym
- Nutrition: Cook more, eat more fresh, less sugar and removing all the fast food
- Mind: Practising daily meditation

#### Notes

It's in the long run that this one will become harder and harder.
