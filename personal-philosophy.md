# Personal Philosophy

## Career

I want to become leader in designing interfaces and thinking about the user experiences.
I want to become way better at JavaScript and for that, I need to learn and fully understand the 'You don't know JS books' and assimilate some of the trendy techs/concepts ([state of JavaScript](https://2019.stateofjs.com/)).
I also wanna learn more about design pattern in both Java and JavaScript and write always better code for that reading refactoring will help.

Learn about how to design, how to do better UX, about CSS skills,...

I wanna grow my self-discipline, running, doing to gym, reading more, waking up earlier, cooking food and taking on more challenging tasks.

## Career - sidetrack

I also wanna become a smarter at people and be able to develop them for that I need to continue learning about soft skills and implementing it. I wanna be calmer, happier and more optimist for that I need to continue meditation/yoga and see if there are some training's on online course about those topics.

Because my goal is to leave Belgium, English will become more important in my future, so getting better at it will be helpful in my job and my life.

## Private life

I want to become better at drawing and painting, for this I should take lessons to improve my drawing skills.
I want money to have wonderful travels, going to Canada, spotting Moses in Sweden,...
